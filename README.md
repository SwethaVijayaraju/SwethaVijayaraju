## Programming Languages:
* Python (Intermediate)
* HTML/CSS/Javascript (Intermediate)
* SQL (Basic)

## Courses:
* **Programming for Everybody** [[course]](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python) [[certificate]](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/JH6EAWYBS4C6) [[code]](https://github.com/SwethaVijayaraju/Python_for_Everybody/tree/master/Getting_Started_with_Python)
  * Learned the language constructs to solve problems in a programmatic way using functions and loops.

* **Python Data Structures**  [[course]](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data) [[certificate]](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/ELJL5N68TAAX) [[code]](https://github.com/SwethaVijayaraju/Python_for_Everybody/tree/master/Python_Data_Structures)
  * Used data structures like list, set, tuple and dictionaries to store composite data. Understood the inner workings (time/space complexity) of each data structure to choose the appropriate one for the problem at hand.
  * Used python libraries to interact (read/write) with files.
  * Comfortable with multi-step tasks like binary searching and sorting.

* **Using Python to Access Web Data** [[course]](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-network-data) [[certificate]](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/PFE3GZXDJENU) [[code]](https://github.com/SwethaVijayaraju/Python_for_Everybody/tree/master/Web_Data_Access)
  * Used the urllib package to fetch data(JSON/XML) from webpages and parse them.
  * Used BeautifulSoup and regular expression to fetch and parse data from webpages that return HTML content.

* **Data Science for Construction, Architecture and Engineering** [[course]](https://www.edx.org/course/Data-Science-for-Construction-Architecture-and-Engineering) [[certificate]](https://courses.edx.org/certificates/5bbe69a4baab4092a5f9df718c9594b6) [[code]](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uAVMsMZs6vYyVioXF3tnylpv_it7icZe?usp=sharing)
  * Used Pandas library to perform time series analysis of building electricity usage vs outdoor temperature reading to understand electricity usage for different building types across different seasons. 
  * Used [AHRAE](http://www.comfortdatabase.com/) Thermal Comfort Database to analyze and visualize how personal preference of comfort changes across different regions based on building temperature level. I also used the Seaborn plot library on top of pandas to display better visualizations for scatter and box plots.
  * Used Pandas machine learning library to build simple classifiers(K-Means) to group building electric usage over a year. E.g., the model automatically identifies without data labeling that electricity usage during months May, June and July fall under the same group(high consumption).
  * Built a simple linear regression model(KNeighborsRegressor) to predict electricity usage of a building for a month using data from previous months. Calculated the error(Mean Absolute Error) based on the predicted vs actual usage over that month.

## Mini Projects:
* Created and hosted a website/blog [(swethavraj.com)](https://swethavraj.com/) using an existing theme based on Jekyll. I [modified](https://github.com/SwethaVijayaraju/SwethaVijayaraju.github.io/commit/2b85d293f187ad6a42ddf8969655279fd1375e6b) several HTML/CSS pages to publish a simple and neatly styled blog [[code]](https://github.com/SwethaVijayaraju/SwethaVijayaraju.github.io). This website empowers me to share my thoughts and passion for design and travel.	

* Created a Github [repo](https://github.com/SwethaVijayaraju/Python_lesson) as I was learning python to keep notes and practice assignments for myself and future readers. Some of the fun projects I did were microcosms of real-world apps like [Tinder](https://github.com/SwethaVijayaraju/Python_lesson/blob/master/Assignments/Oops/oops_tinder_multipleapps.py), [Hangman](https://github.com/SwethaVijayaraju/Python_lesson/blob/master/Assignments/Oops/oops_hangman.py), [Ticket reservation](https://github.com/SwethaVijayaraju/Python_lesson/blob/master/Assignments/Oops/oops_theatre.py) and [Simulating robot movement in a 2D grid](https://github.com/SwethaVijayaraju/Python_lesson/blob/master/Assignments/Oops/oops_robot.py). This helped me understand the nuances of the language, most importantly, Object-Oriented programming.
